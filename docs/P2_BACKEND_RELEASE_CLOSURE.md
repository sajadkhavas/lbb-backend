## Closure result

P2 confirms that the accepted backend remains release-grade after a fresh September 2026 audit. No application/runtime PHP or API contract rewrite was required. The accepted implementation is now promoted to authoritative backend `main` and frozen at `BACKEND_RELEASE_SHA`.

## Fresh security remediation

- `league/commonmark`: `2.8.3` → `2.10.0`.
- `livewire/livewire`: `3.8.2` → `3.8.7`.
- Root Laravel framework remained `12.64.0`.
- Security refresh was bounded to `composer.lock`.
- `composer validate --strict`: PASS.
- `composer audit --locked`: no security advisories.
- Temporary security helper was removed before the final exact-head gate.

## Freeze semantics

`BACKEND_RELEASE_SHA = dd35070ddb168833d30adabde957b86b56da0542`.

This SHA is the runtime backend source freeze produced by source PR #14. This post-merge registration branch changes documentation only and must not redefine the runtime freeze SHA.

## Deployment readiness boundary

`docs/P2_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` records immutable release, queue/scheduler, backup, migration-review and rollback prerequisites. It does not authorize server activation. Checkout, payment, SMS and Web Push remain fail-closed until their explicit production gates have approved real credentials/configuration.

## Registration gate

This documentation-only registration PR must pass the complete `P2 Backend Release Freeze` workflow before merge and before issue #13 closes. Production/server mutation remains **NO**.

## NEXT after registration

`P3 — Frontend ↔ Backend Live Integration`, GitHub-first. Actual server deployment/activation remains a later explicit gate.
