## Freeze semantics

`dd35070ddb168833d30adabde957b86b56da0542` is the backend runtime source freeze. Documentation-only registration changes do not redefine `BACKEND_RELEASE_SHA`.

## Remaining P2 registration steps

1. Pass the complete P2 Release Freeze workflow on this documentation-only registration PR.
2. Merge the registration PR with expected-head protection.
3. Close issue #13 as completed with all acceptance items checked.
4. Update the LBB frontend Master Handoff with the backend release SHA and advance `CURRENT NEXT` to P3.

Actual Production activation remains outside this GitHub-only stage and requires its own later explicit server gate.
